/**
 * @title UpgradedTokenMock
 * This mock just provides introduces new state and modifies the minting function for
 *  testing purposes.
 *
 * NOTE: The new state should be independent of the old state to avoid having to go
 *  through an expensive (and complicated/dangerous) migration process. For example,
 *  it's not straight forward to deploy ERC721BasicToken and then later upgrade to
 *  ERC721Token because of how much the mint/transfer logic changes. A better example
 *  would be to migrate to change the fee structure of the minting/transfer functions
 *  as seen in this mock.
